# The Hummingbird Project
As a result of "losing" my mongopush source code, I rewrote it but on a smaller scale.  I couldn't get much meaningful help in my previous close source project.  To support many use cases is too big an effort for a person to take on, especially the oplogs streaming part which is in fact a reverse engineering of replication.  I still think it is a great idea and many can benefit from it.  So, here you go, an open source project.  Contributions are welcome.

The idea of the repository name was from the movie [The Hummingbird Project (2018)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hummingbird_Project).  The world needs good ideas to move forward.  Birds can't fly over the ocean, not because they lack courage, but because there is no one waiting on the other side.
